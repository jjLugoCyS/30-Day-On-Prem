# 30-Day-On-Prem

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on-premises. The project will focus on, deploying and configuring an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, process, and visualize security-relevant data, setting up a Fleet Server to manage and monitor Elastic Agents deployed on various systems and keep it all centralized, provisioning Windows and Linux server environments for testing and demonstration purposes, integrating a Mythic C2 server to simulate cyberattacks and assess the SIEM's detection capabilities, ans deploying an OSTicket server for incident management and ticketing. The overall goal is to establish a robust SIEM solution capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats within the organization.
