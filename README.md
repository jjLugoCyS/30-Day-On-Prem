# 30-Day-On-Prem

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on-premises. The project will focus on, deploying and configuring an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, process, and visualize security-relevant data, setting up a Fleet Server to manage and monitor Elastic Agents deployed on various systems and keep it all centralized, provisioning Windows and Linux server environments for testing and demonstration purposes, integrating a Mythic C2 server to simulate cyberattacks and assess the SIEM's detection capabilities, ans deploying an OSTicket server for incident management and ticketing. The overall goal is to establish a robust SIEM solution capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats within the organization.

### Skills Learned

ELK Stack: Proficiency in Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Understanding of SIEM concepts, best practices, and use cases.
Network and System Administration: Knowledge of network protocols, system configurations, and troubleshooting techniques.
Security Tools and Technologies: Familiarity with tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and other security assessment tools.
Scripting and Automation: Experience with scripting languages (e.g., Python, PowerShell) for automating tasks and integrating with the SIEM.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
