# 30-Day-On-Prem

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on-premises. The project will focus on, deploying and configuring an ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, process, and visualize security-relevant data, setting up a Fleet Server to manage and monitor Elastic Agents deployed on various systems and keep it all centralized, provisioning Windows and Linux server environments for testing and demonstration purposes, integrating a Mythic C2 server to simulate cyberattacks and assess the SIEM's detection capabilities, ans deploying an OSTicket server for incident management and ticketing. The overall goal is to establish a robust SIEM solution capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to security threats within the organization.

### Skills Learned

ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Understanding of SIEM concepts, best practices, and use cases.
Network and System Administration: Knowledge of system configurations and troubleshooting techniques.
Security Tools and Technologies: Familiarity with tools like Kali, osTicket, and other security assessment tools.
Problem-solving: Ability to identify and troubleshoot issues related to SIEM deployments and data analysis.
Analytical Thinking: Skill in analyzing large datasets to identify security threats and patterns.
Attention to Detail: Meticulous approach to ensure accurate data collection and analysis.
Continuous Learning: A mindset of staying updated with the latest security threats and technologies.

### Tools Used

Elasticsearch: For storing and analyzing large volumes of data.
Logstash: Collects, processes, and transforms data from various sources.
Kibana: A powerful visualization tool for exploring and analyzing data stored in Elasticsearch.
Beats: Lightweight data shippers (e.g., Filebeat, Auditbeat, Metricbeat) to collect data from various sources.
Threat Intelligence Platforms: Tools to gather and analyze threat intelligence data.
Configuration Management Tools: To automate the deployment and configuration of the SIEM components.
